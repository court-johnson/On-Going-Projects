*A work in progress*

GUI application created with Python and [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) using [WeatherUnderground's API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/). 

Application currently provides a three-day weather forecast by zipcode and presents an up-to-date weather radar map.
